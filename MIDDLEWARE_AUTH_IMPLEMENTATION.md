# Middleware Authentication Implementation

## Overview
The middleware has been successfully enhanced to implement comprehensive authentication checks for your Next.js application with Supabase.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Session Retrieval from Supabase Auth Cookies ✅
- Uses `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr` to properly handle cookies
- Retrieves the session using `supabase.auth.getSession()`
- Handles cookie operations (get, set, remove) for proper session management

### 2. Protected Route Authentication ✅
- When accessing protected routes without a valid session:
  - Redirects to the login page (`/`)
  - Preserves the original destination in `redirectTo` query parameter
  - User can be redirected back after successful authentication

### 3. JWT Token Parsing ✅
- Uses `decodeJwt` from the `jose` library to parse the access token
- Extracts user metadata including:
  - User ID (`sub` claim)
  - Email address
  - User role from multiple possible locations:
    - Direct `role` claim
    - `user_metadata.role`
    - `app_metadata.role`

### 4. Role Storage for Authorization ✅
- Stores extracted user information in response headers:
  - `x-user-id`: User's unique identifier
  - `x-user-email`: User's email address
  - `x-user-role`: User's role for downstream authorization
- Falls back to database query if role not found in JWT
- These headers are available to all downstream components

### 5. Route-Specific Authorization ✅
- Implements role-based access control (RBAC)
- Checks user roles against required roles for specific routes
- Role hierarchy:
  - `super_admin`: Full access to all routes
  - `admin`: Access to admin and lower routes
  - `dispatcher`: Access to dispatcher and driver routes
  - `driver`: Access to driver routes only
- Redirects to `/unauthorized` if user lacks required role

### 6. Smart Redirects ✅
- Authenticated users accessing login/signup pages are redirected to role-appropriate dashboards:
  - Admin/Super Admin → `/admin`
  - Dispatcher → `/dispatcher`
  - Driver → `/driver`
  - Others → `/dashboard`

## File Modified
- `/src/middleware.ts` - Main middleware implementation

## Dependencies Added
- `jose` - For JWT token decoding and parsing

## Protected Routes Configuration
```typescript
const PROTECTED_ROUTES = [
  '/dashboard',
  '/profile',
  '/settings',
  '/admin',
  '/dispatcher',
  '/driver',
  '/api/protected',
];
```

## Role-Based Route Configuration
```typescript
const ROLE_ROUTES = {
  '/admin': ['admin', 'super_admin'],
  '/dispatcher': ['dispatcher', 'admin', 'super_admin'],
  '/driver': ['driver', 'dispatcher', 'admin', 'super_admin'],
  // ... additional route configurations
};
```

## Testing
A test file (`test-middleware-auth.js`) has been created to demonstrate the expected behavior of the middleware under various scenarios.

## Security Features
1. **Session validation** on every request to protected routes
2. **JWT token parsing** for role extraction without additional API calls
3. **Fallback to database** if role information not in JWT
4. **Proper error handling** with appropriate redirects
5. **Role-based access control** with hierarchical permissions
6. **Secure cookie handling** using Supabase SSR client

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Add rate limiting for authentication attempts
2. Implement refresh token rotation
3. Add audit logging for access attempts
4. Consider implementing IP-based restrictions for admin routes
5. Add support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) checks
